## Task 1: Setting Up the Project Environment

### Date: 10/09/2023
### Approach/Methodology:
- Initialized a new Node.js project.
- Configured the development environment including necessary dependencies and database setup.

### Challenges/Problems Faced:
- Deciding on the appropriate Node.js framework and database management system.
- Ensuring compatibility between different versions of dependencies.

### Steps Followed:
1. **Project Initialization**: Ran `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Installed Express, Sequelize, MySQL, and other necessary libraries using NPM.
3. **Environment Setup**: Created a `.env` file for storing sensitive configuration data.

### Overall Analysis:
- The setup was smooth. The chosen stack (Node.js, Express, Sequelize) is well-suited for building RESTful APIs.

## Task 2: Designing the Database Schema

### Date: 11/09/2023
### Approach/Methodology:
- Designed a relational database schema to model customers, accounts, and transactions.

### Challenges/Problems Faced:
- Ensuring normalization and efficient data retrieval with the database design.

### Steps Followed:
1. **Schema Drafting**: Created an initial draft of tables and their relationships.
2. **Schema Refinement**: Normalized the database schema to avoid redundancy.

### Overall Analysis:
- The database schema effectively represents the required data entities and their relationships.

## Task 3: Building RESTful API Endpoints

### Date: 11/09/2023
### Approach/Methodology:
- Implemented API endpoints following RESTful principles for handling customer, account, and transaction data.

### Challenges/Problems Faced:
- Handling edge cases and implementing robust error handling in API responses.

### Steps Followed:
1. **Endpoint Creation**: Developed routes and controllers for each API operation (CRUD).
2. **Validation Implementation**: Added input validation for each endpoint.
3. **Testing Endpoints**: Used Postman to test each endpoint for correctness.

### Overall Analysis:
- The API is functional and handles CRUD operations effectively. Edge case handling enhances its robustness.

## Task 4: Integrating Logging and Error Handling

### Date: 12/09/2023
### Approach/Methodology:
- Integrated Winston for logging and implemented comprehensive error handling across the application.

### Challenges/Problems Faced:
- Configuring Winston for different environments (development vs production).
- Ensuring that all errors are captured and logged without leaking sensitive information.

### Steps Followed:
1. **Logger Configuration**: Set up Winston with different transports for console and file logging.
2. **Integrating Logger**: Integrated the logger into routes, controllers, and middleware.
3. **Error Handling**: Developed middleware for consistent error responses.

### Overall Analysis:
- The logging system provides valuable insights into the application's operation and assists in debugging. Error handling is consistent and informative.

## Overall Project Analysis

The Banking Application project involved building a RESTful API with a focus on clean architecture, robust error handling, and efficient data management. Key strengths of the project include its modular design, clear API documentation, and comprehensive logging system. Challenges primarily revolved around edge case handling and ensuring data integrity. Future improvements could include implementing advanced security features, such as OAuth for authentication and data encryption for sensitive information storage.
